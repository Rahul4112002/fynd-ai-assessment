h_y-oqC4xEECVeB09nQ8ZQ,1,1,"The review is overwhelmingly negative across all aspects: parking, ambiance, exceptionally poor and snobby service, extremely long wait times for food, a lamp going out, and unappetizing food for a high price. The reviewer explicitly states, 'I am recommending that you not go there,' which strongly indicates the lowest possible rating.",True,,Zero-Shot
s0dRHCNMgMjDdlvG6XZ66Q,1,1,"The review explicitly states the experience was 'subpar to say the least' and service was 'HORRENDOUS'. Multiple issues with service, including a disappearing waitress and not returning for payment, were highlighted. Food was described as 'overpriced,' with one roll being 'really bad.' The concluding sentence, 'I have no intention of ingesting there food ever again!', clearly indicates an extremely negative experience deserving of the lowest possible rating.",True,,Zero-Shot
tTGXjt1QZcBnfNmrYLCYKA,1,1,"The review expresses extreme dissatisfaction, highlighting 'SMALLEST wings I have ever seen' and feeling 'punked.' The concluding 'Never to be back' confirms a thoroughly negative experience. While it mentions flavor choices and taste as the 'only reason 1 star can be given,' this phrasing suggests that even a minor positive couldn't salvage the overwhelmingly poor experience, leading to the lowest possible rating.",True,,Zero-Shot
iOABod6-D0_5jcy0U1-7KQ,1,1,"The review expresses extreme anger and frustration, repeatedly stating the staff is 'incredibly useless,' the store is unhelpful, and customer service was dismissive. The customer explicitly promises 'to never go back' and recommends competitors. All sentiments are overwhelmingly negative.",True,,Zero-Shot
Us61PFnfQTMrX-xR3dd2jw,1,1,"The review expresses extreme dissatisfaction, citing a fourth instance of 'crappy service', being unable to order dinner due to unannounced kitchen closure after ordering appetizers, overpriced entrees, and the inconvenience of having to find another restaurant. The customer explicitly states 'we won't be giving them another chance,' reinforcing a completely negative experience.",True,,Zero-Shot
qQcvmt1tvMR3F5OolsIRPg,1,1,"The review details an overwhelmingly negative experience. The server provided 'very cold treatment,' a 'look of pure distaste,' and was 'condescending.' The dessert itself was described as 'stale-looking' with 'cracked edges' and ice cream that had 'ice crystals,' indicating poor quality and presentation compared to previous visits. The reviewer explicitly states they will 'never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore' and 'won't be returning.' This combination of extremely poor service and unsatisfactory food quality warrants a 1-star rating.",True,,Zero-Shot
-7qEdFzHUZqwn_g25tjReg,1,1,"The review expresses strong disappointment, citing severe cleanliness issues across multiple areas (lobby, salsa bar, drink station) and unacceptable food quality (old guacamole, limp lettuce). These are critical failures leading to a terrible experience.",True,,Zero-Shot
Nr-6xqBN9XqBJXnCToYYKA,1,1,"The review details multiple severe issues: a bag was stolen while the customer was trying on shoes, and the store staff reacted with complete indifference, refusing to offer help, call security/police, or even condolences. Beyond this critical incident, the store is described as a 'mess' with clothes everywhere, and staff were scarce, unprofessional, and socializing instead of assisting customers or maintaining the store. The only positive note is a general appreciation for the brand's fashion, which is heavily overshadowed by the overwhelmingly negative experience at this specific location.",True,,Zero-Shot
dB62OZ5qf6S4X-Zu9FcUqA,1,1,"The review expresses extreme dissatisfaction with nearly every aspect of the dining experience, despite a minor positive note about not getting ill and the fries being good. The sandwich, the main item, was described as 'flavorless' and tasting 'like stale bread.' The price was considered exorbitant for the quality and portion size ('$29.98 for 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas (its an effin sandwich!!!)'). The portion size was also misleadingly described as 'HUGE' by others but found to be insufficient. The overall tone is one of severe disappointment and regret.",True,,Zero-Shot
MNFvGY1zUVGQlImzqvMFQw,1,1,"The review expresses extreme dissatisfaction due to the waitress's rude and unprofessional behavior, unnecessary rushing, and incompetence with handling the bill and change. The reviewer explicitly states the waitress 'completely ruined' the atmosphere, despite liking it previously. The tone is highly negative and sarcastic, indicating a terrible customer experience.",True,,Zero-Shot
dzAwZL5AELxjhlP0fm7foQ,1,1,"The review highlights severe issues including multiple hairs found in the food, bland and tasteless dishes, confusing ordering process, poor service from dismissive staff, and having to retrieve own sodas. The presence of hair in food is a critical hygiene failure, making a 1-star rating appropriate despite one dish being described as 'OK'.",True,,Zero-Shot

However, it also expresses very strong positive sentiment for the atmosphere, unique desserts/drinks, and overall entertainment value, stating the reviewer 'will continue to come for the fun atmosphere.' The severe criticism of the food, a core offering, heavily weighs down the rating, but the clear intent to return for other positive aspects prevents it from being a 1-star rating.",True,,Zero-Shot
SYK_LgV8wDoezdu9acfz2w,1,1,"The review is overwhelmingly negative, detailing numerous frustrations and malfunctions. The reviewer experienced confusion with the payment system, difficulty with a unique nozzle design, pumps not working correctly, failure to receive a receipt, and significant wasted time and effort. The language used ('Stupid ampm station', 'torment me', 'Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.') clearly indicates extreme dissatisfaction and a terrible experience. The humorous disclaimer about the reviewer's intelligence further emphasizes how poorly designed or maintained the station's system must be if it frustrates even a competent individual.",True,,Zero-Shot

They express significant disappointment, expecting 'so much better' from a restaurant in that location. While acknowledging they are 'super critical,' the strong negative descriptions for core items, combined with mediocrity for the rest, point to a poor overall experience, meriting a 2-star rating.",True,,Zero-Shot
BK4FpIlwDx2mAhk9qsK3sQ,2,1,"The review is overwhelmingly negative, describing the food as 'bland and lackluster,' 'flavorless,' 'disgusting,' and having an 'off-putting texture.' There were also significant complaints about incredibly long wait times, the restaurant running out of bread, and inconsistent drink quality. Despite a nice patio, the core dining experience was deemed terrible, leading the reviewer to explicitly state they would not return.",True,,Zero-Shot
b-HCYV8EvvyXHip5Fw9rHQ,2,1,"Despite mentioning several positive aspects like location, decor, service, and specific menu items (bread, desserts), the review culminates in severe hygiene issues (dead fly in salad, hair on pickle spear) and consistent food preparation problems (sandwich assembly, flavorless wrap). The concluding statement, 'guarantee I will not return,' clearly indicates a fundamentally unacceptable experience, overriding any positives and warranting the lowest possible rating.",True,,Zero-Shot
PPKxod62hSbSuwm6XJv1vg,2,2,"The reviewer explicitly states 'Love the coffee' which is a strong positive for the product. However, the entire rest of the review details consistently poor, unprofessional, and frustrating service experiences, including baristas not being ready, smoking outside, and perceived slacking. The significant and repeated service issues heavily outweigh the single positive aspect, leading to a very poor overall experience despite the good coffee.",True,,Zero-Shot
vY9uNDrKcTFKlFrQULrcCg,2,1,"Despite initial praise for the queso and tortillas, the review details numerous severe negatives: a 'lousy' soup, underwhelming fajitas, 'lousy' service, a 'foul' smell in the foyer, and most critically, a bug found in the water with a dismissive staff response and inadequate compensation. The overall sentiment is 'fails on almost everything' and a definite intention not to return, indicating a truly terrible experience.",True,,Zero-Shot
yeMNAZKxXf4T2MgBMYAH4Q,2,2,"While some specific items like chips, red salsa, chicken, and service were praised, the review highlights significant disappointments with core components like the green sauce (described as 'so blah I couldn't eat it') and the beans and rice ('disappointing'). The overall sentiment leans negative with the concluding remark 'I was not impressed,' indicating that the negatives outweighed the positives for the reviewer.",True,,Zero-Shot
YU9-0d4OeOEZuqFYs1xvPw,2,2,"Despite the positive notes on setting and service, the reviewer explicitly states these don't compensate for the core issue: expensive food ($14 burger) that was poor quality (average at best and overcooked for all three). This indicates a significantly negative overall experience due to the main product.",True,,Zero-Shot
62RkOn0aW7EG5TGFb1rK4g,2,1,"The review expresses clear disappointment with the food preparation and taste, using phrases like 'I was disappointed' and 'wasn't that good.'

The conclusive statement, 'Next time I'll go to El Brava and pass by the 12th!', indicates strong dissatisfaction and a clear preference for an alternative, even the fast-food stand they initially avoided. While service itself wasn't explicitly bad, the overall experience was inefficient and disappointing, leading to a poor rating.",True,,Zero-Shot
TgehaXzkJHxD4isfJ_-lcQ,2,2,"The review highlights consistent and severe issues with service (rude, annoyed staff), efficiency (drinks take forever), order accuracy (messed up orders last 2 times), and environment (sweeping while customers relax). While the reviewer states the most recent visit was 'better', they explicitly confirm they are 'not going to change my rating until after my next visit', indicating the numerous negative experiences still outweigh the single positive one. The overwhelming sentiment is disappointment and a decision to avoid this location.",True,,Zero-Shot

50DlJdkf0jtG-CQLDx8jGQ,2,1,"The review is overwhelmingly negative, citing major issues with the core karaoke experience (tiny, airless room for 10, outdated song selection), mediocre to poorly prepared food (undercooked edamame), undesirable crowd, and service errors. The only positive note was the 'sweet' servers, but this was immediately followed by service mistakes. The phrase 'Had we known, we would not have gone there' strongly indicates extreme dissatisfaction.",True,,Zero-Shot
5JVIkHaT8zb3AB9UzdcAuA,2,1,"The review starts with a positive memory but quickly pivots to a highly negative recent experience. Key phrases like 'nothing like it used to be,' 'lacking in flavor,' 'way too much seasoning on them, none of us ate them,' and 'gone way down hill, I won't be going here anymore' indicate extreme dissatisfaction and a complete lack of intent to return, justifying a 1-star rating.",True,,Zero-Shot

The overall sentiment is one of extreme dissatisfaction and disappointment, warranting the lowest possible rating.",True,,Zero-Shot
HyjTny7cPNMsyBn5Mi4vrA,2,1,"The review uses overwhelmingly negative language such as 'gross', 'dried out', 'terrible flavor', and repeatedly states it was a 'terrible sandwich'. The only 'saving grace' mentioned was its small size, implying less of a bad experience, which reinforces the negative sentiment about the food itself. The self-blame for a misunderstanding about the patty type does not diminish the strong negative judgment of the sandwich's quality.",True,,Zero-Shot
mbWqhyCAB9kb9VS837WPMA,2,1,"The review is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing the restaurant's authenticity, food quality (calling it 'false advertising' and stating they 'FAIL rice' thus 'FAIL sushi'), atmosphere ('pseudo-asian theme park'), and owner's priorities. The only potential positive (happy hour/patio) is explicitly stated not to be for the reviewer, reinforcing extreme dissatisfaction.",True,,Zero-Shot

The positive food aspect prevents a 1-star rating, but the significant service failure and the customer's decision not to return warrant a low rating.",True,,Zero-Shot

While the gas itself wasn't explicitly bad, the car broke down immediately after filling up, another car was already broken down, and other patrons refused to help.

The concluding remark, that it's 'more of a fun/interesting place to go before you go out to dinner,' indicates a significant failure in its primary function as a dinner spot due to value and satiety issues, despite its appealing qualities.

wg3N8cP7-C6qQtWVPDSt4w,2,2,"The review details numerous significant and systemic issues, including receiving a different apartment, constant breakages of essential appliances and fixtures (shower, lights, stove, washer), higher water costs, and disorganized staff. The phrase 'my house is falling apart!' highlights the severity. However, the reviewer explicitly states, 'the only reason i give it 2 stars is because i do know there are a lot worse apartments out there', indicating a rating that is predominantly negative with major complaints but not the absolute lowest given their personal context.",True,,Few-Shot
LUPEqsBJ_1Dr3LqPbZe1bA,2,2,"The review features significant negative feedback regarding the main course (described as 'definitely the worst' gyro) and the seating arrangement ('I hate this. It's just awkward...sucks...'), which are strong detractors. While the service was praised as 'very nice and attentive' and the appetizer was 'definitely good,' these positive points are heavily outweighed by the core complaints about the food and environment. The reviewer explicitly states they considered it 'closed to a 2.5, but rounded down to 2', aligning with a predominantly negative experience despite some redeeming qualities.",True,,Few-Shot
KoH2U6Pf3X02Zs4cA_I6bw,2,2,"The review expresses significant disappointment with key items (guacamole and salsa described as 'not very good at all') and general food ('just okay'), especially given the restaurant's location. While the reviewer admits to being 'super critical,' the overall sentiment is clearly negative and falls short of expectations, indicating multiple complaints rather than a neutral or satisfactory experience.",True,,Few-Shot
BK4FpIlwDx2mAhk9qsK3sQ,2,1,"Extremely negative review detailing numerous severe issues: bland/disgusting food, incredibly long waits for food and drinks, operational failures (running out of bread), inconsistent drink quality, and an overall 'reeling in horror' experience that ensures they will not return. The specific descriptions of the food highlight multiple profound failures.",True,,Few-Shot
b-HCYV8EvvyXHip5Fw9rHQ,2,1,"Despite some positive comments about the location, décor, service, and specific menu items (like bread, cookies), the review contains multiple severe complaints. The discovery of a dead fly in a salad and a hair on a pickle are critical hygiene failures. These issues, combined with consistent problems in sandwich assembly and the explicit statement 'guarantee I will not return,' indicate an overwhelmingly negative overall experience that warrants the lowest possible rating.",True,,Few-Shot
PPKxod62hSbSuwm6XJv1vg,2,2,"The review expresses appreciation for the product ('Love the coffee') but is overwhelmingly negative regarding the service. It details multiple recurring instances of staff being unavailable and unprofessional (smoking on the patio, not behind the counter), leading to a significantly negative overall experience despite the good coffee.",True,,Few-Shot
vY9uNDrKcTFKlFrQULrcCg,2,1,"Despite initial praise for queso, tortillas, and chips/salsa, the review highlights numerous severe issues. These include a 'hilariously underwhelming' soup, sparsely topped fajitas, 'lousy' service, a critical incident of finding a bug in water with an unsatisfactory staff response, a 'foul' smell in the foyer, and the strong sentiment that the place 'fails on almost everything.' The intent not to return and discourage others reinforces an overwhelmingly negative experience.",True,,Few-Shot
yeMNAZKxXf4T2MgBMYAH4Q,2,2,"The review presents a mixed experience, highlighting specific positive aspects like chips, red salsa, chicken, and service. However, it also details significant disappointments with the green sauce (lacking flavor) and the beans and rice. The concluding statement 'I was not impressed' signifies an overall negative sentiment despite some good points, aligning with a predominantly negative but not terrible experience.",True,,Few-Shot
YU9-0d4OeOEZuqFYs1xvPw,2,2,"The review highlights positive aspects (setting, service) but explicitly states they 'don't make up for' the significant negative issues concerning the food (overpriced, average at best, and overcooked).

The sheer volume and severity of negative points indicate a profoundly unsatisfactory experience, consistent with a 1-star rating.",True,,Few-Shot
i1TGrBBeDCzEHULlV6NUXw,2,2,"The review indicates significant disappointment. While the service 'wasn't bad' initially, the 'long, long time' wait is a major negative, especially for an airport location. The menu was 'limited,' and the food was merely 'ok' but 'pricey' and 'non memorable.' The concluding statement, 'Next time I'll go to El Brava and pass by the 12th!', clearly indicates a negative experience and a lack of intent to return, aligning with a predominantly negative but not catastrophic rating.",True,,Few-Shot
TgehaXzkJHxD4isfJ_-lcQ,2,1,"This review is overwhelmingly negative despite an initial disclaimer about loving the brand. It lists multiple severe and recurring issues specific to this location: consistently rude service, slow drink preparation, messed up orders (twice), and disruptive cleaning practices. The reviewer explicitly states they will try other locations due to these problems. While there's a slight positive update about a single visit, the reviewer explicitly states they are 'not going to change my rating' based on it, indicating the overall negative sentiment and low rating stand.",True,,Few-Shot

50DlJdkf0jtG-CQLDx8jGQ,2,1,"The review highlights numerous fundamental and severe issues: an unacceptably small room, outdated song choices, mediocre and undercooked food, and a negative crowd experience. The reviewer explicitly states, 'Had we known, we would not have gone there,' indicating a complete dissatisfaction with the overall experience.

HyjTny7cPNMsyBn5Mi4vrA,2,1,"The review uses strong negative language such as 'gross', 'dried out', and 'terrible flavor'.

The phrase 'the only saving grace was that it was small' reinforces the extreme dissatisfaction.",True,,Few-Shot
mbWqhyCAB9kb9VS837WPMA,2,1,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, highly critical, and sarcastic. It lambastes the restaurant's authenticity, management priorities, atmosphere, and fundamental food quality (especially the sushi rice), going so far as to accuse them of 'false advertising.' The only potential 'saving grace' is explicitly stated not to apply to the reviewer, indicating an extremely poor experience.",True,,Few-Shot
nDhRLnmtlSoVVUA3y8dw7g,2,4,"The review highlights several positive aspects like 'organic and fun presentation', 'great one stop shop', 'unique style', and 'fabulous place to take a peek in'. The only negatives are personal preferences ('a little greasy for my skin', 'just not for me'), which acknowledge the product's qualities but indicate it's not a personal fit for the reviewer, rather than criticizing the product itself. This makes it a generally positive review.",True,,Few-Shot
mxRy3Hf9xpNxgwMqHWHJUg,2,1,"The review expresses strong negative sentiment, implying poor food preparation ('shockingly hot and fast... microwave usage'), directly stating the food was 'mediocre and overpriced', and most damningly, describing the restaurant as becoming 'both a barometer and a joke'. The recommendation to 'yelp something else' further emphasizes a completely unsatisfactory experience, aligning with a 'terrible experience' despite not explicitly mentioning rude service or dirty conditions.",True,,Few-Shot
R_wTpXKH3zkHzrleYGtUUg,2,1,"Despite initial excitement, the review details multiple severe negative experiences, including consistently misleading operating hours, feeling unwelcome on several occasions, and a lack of basic amenities like water.

w_1eaDHCD8DGXUPD1RbP5A,2,2,"The reviewer explicitly states their intention to give two stars and provides a detailed breakdown supporting this. While acknowledging that some food items were 'great' or 'really good,' these positive points are significantly overshadowed by numerous severe complaints regarding the 'chintzy' interior, an extremely 'surly' and unhelpful staff member, and distracting, nonsensical television entertainment. The negative aspects concerning service and atmosphere heavily outweigh the positive food experience, leading the reviewer to conclude with a 2-star rating.",True,,Few-Shot
RcDdftzr2gEFhr6KqR0_SA,2,2,"Despite the food being 'pretty good,' the severe issue with service (an hour wait despite a reservation) was significant enough for the reviewer to state they 'would not go back.'

mwoOdGi6RoZYnbXMxKToyg,2,2,"The review highlights significant disappointments with main meal items (oily bland burger, bad onion rings), slow service despite the restaurant being empty, and poor value for the burger. While some items (salad, deviled eggs) were okay and the ambiance was liked, the overall experience for a sit-down meal was negative enough to conclude that 'there are just much better central Phoenix locations,' suggesting a recommendation against dining for a full meal.",True,,Few-Shot
GqMxrKvTrkDeG4ZS5mSlqg,2,1,"The review highlights severe issues with service ('less than lackluster') and product quality ('kegs all seemed flat').

The core service and product were failures.",True,,Few-Shot
TeOHcNOhqCK31DXa5do3ew,2,1,"Extremely negative review with severe criticisms about the food quality (burgers being 'terribly unoriginal' and fries like 'Safeway freezer section') and unprofessional staff ('hungover').

g_rBgIUPJER87CLkOSfY_w,2,2,"The review indicates the food was 'good' but heavily criticizes the high cost and poor value for money, stating 'For half the price, I would give it twice as many Stars.' This strong emphasis on being overpriced despite decent food quality places it in the negative but not terrible category, similar to the 2-star example mentioning 'overpriced'.",True,,Few-Shot
TMgkOvM1iBpkiZADCZdT2g,2,2,"The review explicitly begins by stating 'Two stars for bad service and... a lousy appetizer,' setting a strong negative tone. The detailed description of the appetizer as 'congealed into a rubbery mat,' 'impossible to cut,' and 'tasteless' is extremely negative. Service issues are also highlighted (late table, long wait). While there are significant positive points later in the review (friends' dishes were 'wonderful,' dessert was 'divine,' wine was 'delightful'), and the reviewer expresses willingness to 'give them another chance,' the severity of the initial personal negative experiences with the food and service aligns more closely with a 2-star rating, which denotes a predominantly negative experience with multiple complaints, even if not entirely hostile or without redeeming qualities.",True,,Few-Shot

qN922EcB3wEISGuU9KHl0A,2,2,"The reviewer explicitly states 'They get 2 stars, for the pickles,' despite using extremely strong and negative language ('worst pastrami I have ever had!', 'sucks giant donkey balls') for the main food item and recommending others avoid the place. The 2 stars are attributed solely to the pickles, indicating that a single positive aspect prevented an absolute 1-star rating.",True,,Few-Shot
3vCkW5w6WrRms9Lon8jzHg,2,1,"The review describes an extremely negative and stressful experience, likening the gas station to a 'Bermuda Triangle' where things go wrong. The reviewer's car broke down immediately after filling up at this station, and they were stranded, unable to get help from other patrons. The resolution came from external assistance, not from the gas station itself. This highlights a highly problematic visit, leading to severe inconvenience.",True,,Few-Shot

It uses highly enthusiastic and often hyperbolic language (e.g., 'foodie mecca', 'overwhelmingly awesome!', 'MUST!', 'worth going bananas over!', 'died over that one!', 'foodie nirvana', 'gonna be a blast!!'). While it notes a few minor negative aspects like the truffle scramble being 'not terrific', the coq a vin's texture, a 'cooler-than-thou' waiter, and non-functional outdoor heaters, these are significantly overshadowed by the effusive praise for the overall ambiance, most dishes, and the experience. The review concludes with a strong, direct recommendation, indicating extreme satisfaction and a clear intent for others to visit.

The user is a repeat, registered customer and highlights numerous competitive advantages, including covered parking, complimentary amenities (newspaper, water), discounts, and exceptional promptness for airport drop-off. While a maximum 20-minute wait for pick-up from the airport is mentioned, it's presented factually rather than as a strong complaint, and the reviewer notes the shuttle arrived just as they considered calling.

E3816qsDqj9yCAPEpx5fOg,5,5,"The review exhibits an overwhelmingly positive sentiment, with repeated use of words like 'yummy,' 'awesome,' 'excellent,' and 'so GOOOOOD!'. Multiple visits are detailed, each confirming a great experience, including for a family occasion. The service is explicitly praised ('awesome service') and the food quantity is noted as generous. While there is a minor mention of price being 'pricey' and one dish (Bibimbap) being 'okay' on one occasion, these are heavily outweighed by the strong positive language, the enthusiastic intent to return ('We will be back!!', 'Going to come back soon!'), and the direct recommendation ('Check this place out!'). The intensity of the positive language ('drools', 'Yum-O') indicates an exceptional experience despite minor caveats.",True,,Chain-of-Thought
